Let's perform a detailed dry run of the provided code for the problem "Pancake Sorting" using the example input arr = [3, 2, 4, 1].

Test Case:
Input: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]

Expected Output: [4, 2, 4, 3]

Dry Run:
Initialization:

Input array: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
Result array: result = []
Size of the array: n = 4
First Iteration (size = 4):
Find the index of the maximum element in arr[0..3]:

maxIndex = max_element(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + 4) - arr.begin() = 2 (Element 4 at index 2)
Check if the maximum element is already at the correct position:

Since maxIndex (2) != size - 1 (3), we need to flip.
Flip to bring the maximum element to the front:

Flip at k = 3: Reverse arr[0..2]
New array: arr = [4, 2, 3, 1]
Result after flip: result = [3]
Flip to move the maximum element to its correct position:

Flip at k = 4: Reverse arr[0..3]
New array: arr = [1, 3, 2, 4]
Result after flip: result = [3, 4]
Second Iteration (size = 3):
Find the index of the maximum element in arr[0..2]:

maxIndex = max_element(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + 3) - arr.begin() = 1 (Element 3 at index 1)
Check if the maximum element is already at the correct position:

Since maxIndex (1) != size - 1 (2), we need to flip.
Flip to bring the maximum element to the front:

Flip at k = 2: Reverse arr[0..1]
New array: arr = [3, 1, 2, 4]
Result after flip: result = [3, 4, 2]
Flip to move the maximum element to its correct position:

Flip at k = 3: Reverse arr[0..2]
New array: arr = [2, 1, 3, 4]
Result after flip: result = [3, 4, 2, 3]
Third Iteration (size = 2):
Find the index of the maximum element in arr[0..1]:

maxIndex = max_element(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + 2) - arr.begin() = 0 (Element 2 at index 0)
Check if the maximum element is already at the correct position:

Since maxIndex (0) == size - 1 (1), we skip flipping since 2 is already in the correct position.
End of Iteration:
The size has been reduced to 1, which means the sorting is complete.

Final Result:
The sorted array: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Sequence of flips: result = [3, 4, 2, 3]
Summary of the Steps:
We executed a total of 4 flips, which is within the required limits.
The output of the function will be the array of k-values corresponding to the pancake flips performed to sort the array.

            // Flip the max element to its correct position at the back
            flip(arr, size);
            result.push_back(size);

    vector<int> flips = sol.pancakeSort(arr);
    
    cout << "Flips to sort the array: ";
    for (int k : flips) {
        cout << k << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
Expected Output:
bash
Copy code
Flips to sort the array: 3 4 2 3 
This output corresponds to the flip sizes used to sort the array from [3, 2, 4, 1] to [1, 2, 3, 4].
