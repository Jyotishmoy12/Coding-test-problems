To solve the problem of evaluating a mathematical expression represented as a string (without using built-in functions like eval()), we can use a stack-based approach. The key steps involve parsing the expression, handling different operations while considering their precedence, and managing the order of operations correctly.

Steps to Solve the Problem:
Initialize Variables: Use a stack to store numbers, and maintain a current number and an operator.

Iterate Through the Expression: Loop through each character in the string:

If the character is a digit, build the current number.
If the character is an operator or the end of the string, process the current number and the previous operator:
For + and -, push the number onto the stack (with the sign applied).
For * and /, pop the top number from the stack, apply the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
Handle Edge Cases: Manage spaces and ensure the current number is processed after the last character.

Calculate the Result: Sum all values in the stack to get the final result.

C++ Code Implementation
Here is the complete implementation of the calculate method:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int calculate(std::string s) {
        std::stack<int> stack;
        int currentNumber = 0;
        char operation = '+'; // Initialize the first operation as addition

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char currentChar = s[i];

            if (isdigit(currentChar)) {
                currentNumber = currentNumber * 10 + (currentChar - '0'); // Build the current number
            }

            // If the current character is an operator or it's the last character
            if (!isdigit(currentChar) && !isspace(currentChar) || i == s.length() - 1) {
                if (operation == '+') {
                    stack.push(currentNumber); // Push the current number onto the stack
                } else if (operation == '-') {
                    stack.push(-currentNumber); // Push the negative of the current number
                } else if (operation == '*') {
                    int top = stack.top(); // Get the top number
                    stack.pop(); // Remove it from the stack
                    stack.push(top * currentNumber); // Multiply and push the result
                } else if (operation == '/') {
                    int top = stack.top(); // Get the top number
                    stack.pop(); // Remove it from the stack
                    // Perform integer division (truncate towards zero)
                    stack.push(top / currentNumber); 
                }
                operation = currentChar; // Update the operation
                currentNumber = 0; // Reset current number
            }
        }

        // Sum all values in the stack to get the final result
        int result = 0;
        while (!stack.empty()) {
            result += stack.top();
            stack.pop();
        }
        return result;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::string expression1 = "3+2*2";
    std::string expression2 = " 3/2 ";
    std::string expression3 = " 3+5 / 2 ";

    std::cout << "Result of expression 1: " << solution.calculate(expression1) << std::endl; // Output: 7
    std::cout << "Result of expression 2: " << solution.calculate(expression2) << std::endl; // Output: 1
    std::cout << "Result of expression 3: " << solution.calculate(expression3) << std::endl; // Output: 5

    return 0;
}
Explanation of the Code:
Stack Initialization: A stack is used to store the numbers based on their operations.

Character Parsing: We iterate through each character in the string. When we encounter a digit, we build the number. If we encounter an operator or reach the end of the string, we process the number according to the last operation.

Operation Handling: Depending on the operator (+, -, *, /), we either push the current number onto the stack, pop the top number for multiplication or division, or apply the sign for addition or subtraction.

Final Calculation: Once all characters are processed, we sum the values in the stack to obtain the result.

Dry Run with Test Cases
Let's dry run the code with one of the examples:

Test Case: "3+2*2"
Initialize stack, currentNumber = 0, operation = '+'.

Read characters:

3: Build currentNumber to 3.
+: Push 3 onto the stack. Set operation = '+'. Reset currentNumber = 0.
2: Build currentNumber to 2.
*: Push 2 onto the stack. Set operation = '*'. Reset currentNumber = 0.
2: Build currentNumber to 2.
End of string: Pop 2 from the stack (not yet pushed because of multiplication). Multiply 2 * 2 = 4, push 4 onto the stack.
Stack contains: [3, 4].

Calculate the result: 3 + 4 = 7.

Result:
Output is 7, which is correct.

Conclusion
This approach efficiently evaluates the mathematical expression, adhering to the rules of operator precedence without the need for built-in evaluation functions. The time complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the length of the string, ensuring it can handle the upper constraint effectively. If you have any further questions or need more clarification, feel free to ask!

Sure! Let’s perform a detailed dry run of the provided code using the test case " 3 + 5 / 2 ", which involves both addition and division operations. This will illustrate how the algorithm processes the expression step-by-step.

Test Case: " 3 + 5 / 2 "
Step 1: Initialization

Input: s = " 3 + 5 / 2 "
Initialize:
stack = []
currentNumber = 0
operation = '+'
Step 2: Iterate Through the Characters

Character: ' ' (space)

Skip it (continue to the next character).
Character: '3'

Update currentNumber: currentNumber = 3
Continue to the next character.
Character: ' ' (space)

Skip it (continue to the next character).
Character: '+'

Operation Handling:
Since operation = '+', push currentNumber onto the stack: stack.push(3)
Update operation to '+' (no change here).
Reset currentNumber = 0.
Continue to the next character.
Character: ' ' (space)

Skip it (continue to the next character).
Character: '5'

Update currentNumber: currentNumber = 5
Continue to the next character.
Character: ' ' (space)

Skip it (continue to the next character).
Character: '/'

Operation Handling:
Since operation = '+', push currentNumber onto the stack: stack.push(5)
Update operation to '/'.
Reset currentNumber = 0.
Continue to the next character.
Character: ' ' (space)

Skip it (continue to the next character).
Character: '2'

Update currentNumber: currentNumber = 2
Continue to the next character.
Character: ' ' (space)

Skip it (continue to the next character).
End of String

Operation Handling:
Now we have reached the end of the string, so we need to process the final currentNumber based on the last operation (operation = '/').
Since operation = '/', pop the last number from the stack (top = 5), perform the division:
5 / 2 = 2 (integer division, truncating towards zero).
Push the result back onto the stack: stack.push(2)
Step 3: Final Calculation

Final Stack: After processing the entire string, we have the stack as follows:

stack = [3, 2]
Sum the values in the stack:

result = 0
Pop and sum:
Pop 2: result += 2 → result = 2
Pop 3: result += 3 → result = 5
Final Result: 5

Conclusion
The final output for the input " 3 + 5 / 2 " is 5.

Summary of Steps:
Stack Usage: The stack holds intermediate results based on the last operation encountered.
Current Number Handling: The current number is built from consecutive digit characters until an operator is found, at which point it is processed according to the last operation.
Order of Operations: The algorithm respects operator precedence (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction) through immediate processing of higher precedence operators when encountered.
