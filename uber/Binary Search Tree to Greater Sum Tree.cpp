Your approach to solving the problem "Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree" by initializing a sum and using depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree sounds like a valid method. Let's break down the problem and your approach, ensuring we understand the concept before coding it.

Problem Explanation:
You are given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), and your task is to transform it into a Greater Sum Tree. This means that for each node in the tree, you need to change its value to the sum of its original value plus all values greater than it in the BST.

How to Approach the Problem:
Understanding the BST Property:

In a BST, the values in the right subtree of a node are greater than the node's value. Therefore, to calculate the sum of all keys greater than a node's key, you can traverse the right subtree first.
Use of DFS (Depth-First Search):

You can perform a reverse in-order traversal (right-root-left) to ensure you visit the larger values before the current node. This way, you can keep a running sum of the values you encounter.
Updating Node Values:

During the traversal, update the current node's value to the sum of its original value and the running sum of greater values.
Implementation Steps:

Initialize a variable sum to keep track of the running total.
Define a recursive DFS function that:
Traverses the right subtree.
Updates the current node's value.
Traverses the left subtree.
Pseudocode:
Here’s a high-level overview of how the DFS would work:

python
Copy code
def convertBST(root):
    sum = 0
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return
        # Traverse the right subtree first
        dfs(node.right)
        # Update the current node's value
        sum += node.val
        node.val = sum
        # Traverse the left subtree
        dfs(node.left)
    
    dfs(root)
    return root
C++ Code Implementation:
Here's how you could implement this approach in C++:

cpp
Copy code
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int sum = 0; // To keep track of the sum of nodes greater than the current node

    TreeNode* convertBST(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root);
        return root;
    }

    void dfs(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return; // Base case
        
        // Traverse the right subtree first (greater values)
        dfs(node->right);
        
        // Update the sum and the current node's value
        sum += node->val; // Add current node's value to sum
        node->val = sum;  // Update the current node's value to the new sum
        
        // Traverse the left subtree (smaller values)
        dfs(node->left);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(6);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(0);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(8);
    
    Solution sol;
    sol.convertBST(root);
    
    // Output the updated tree (you can write a helper function to print the tree)
    
    return 0;
}
Dry Run with a Test Case:
Let's dry run the code with the input:

Input Tree: [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Structure:
markdown
Copy code
         4
       /   \
      1     6
     / \   / \
    0   2 5   7
         \     \
          3     8
Execution Steps:
Initialization: sum = 0
DFS Traversal:
Start from the root 4, move to the right 6.
Move to the right 7, then to 8:
sum = 0 + 8 = 8 → Update 7 to 8
Backtrack to 6:
sum = 8 + 6 = 14 → Update 6 to 14
Backtrack to 4:
sum = 14 + 4 = 18 → Update 4 to 18
Move to left subtree of 4, go to 1:
Move to right 2, then to 3:
sum = 18 + 3 = 21 → Update 2 to 21
Backtrack to 1:
sum = 21 + 1 = 22 → Update 1 to 22
Move to left 0:
sum = 22 + 0 = 22 → Update 0 to 22
Final Tree Values:
The final values after transformation will be:

markdown
Copy code
         30
       /   \
      36    21
     / \    / \
    36 35  26  15
               \
                8
Output:
The output will be the modified tree in which each node contains the sum of its original value plus all greater values in the BST.

Conclusion:
Your approach of using DFS to calculate sums and creating new node values in the same place is not only feasible but also efficient for this problem. 
The above implementation reflects that approach, ensuring that the final output meets the problem requirements.
